# Overview

We want to make it as easy as possible for users to become ODPF contributors, so we created this handbook to help you get started. The ODPF team handbook is the central repository for how we build the product within ODPF community.

You will find step-by-step instructions to contribute to development, documentation, and design. Handbook is open to the world and we welcome feedback. Please make a merge request to suggest improvements or add clarifications. Please use issues to ask questions.

## Principles

Following principles play a key role in defining our product and enginering practices:

### Do not re-invent

We aim to not re-invent established best practices and leverage them when applicable and give credit to the original author(s). At the same time, we are open to creating or diverging when certain practices does not serve our purpose.
