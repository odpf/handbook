# Roadmap

Our product [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/odpf/projects/10) is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you. The platform repository is for communicating our roadmap. The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give a sense for how far out each item is on the horizon.

The forward-looking product roadmap does not represent a commitment, guarantee, obligation or promise to deliver any product or feature, or to deliver any product and feature by any particular date, and is intended to outline the general development plans. Customers should not rely on this roadmap to make any decision.
